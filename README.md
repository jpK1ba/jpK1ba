<h1 align=center>Hi, I go by JP</h1>
<p align=center>
  Welcome to my Hub! ðŸ‘‹
  <br><br>
  I'm an Engineer turned Data Scientist. Throughout my Masters' Program, I've had several awesome experiences in applying various algorithms and building different models, e.g., Recommender Systems, Classifier Models (Binary and Multi-class), Regression Models. I'm adept in data wrangling, mining, visualization, analysis, and modelling. 
  <br><br>
  In this hub, you can find some of the personal projects I've had the pleasure of undertaking. Have fun looking around!
